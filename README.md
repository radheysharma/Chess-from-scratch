# Chess-from-scratch
A basic version of chess game that surprisingly implements a lot of features.

Description:
I built this program in my first year of college to learn programming concepts and how to implement ideas into code. This was a project to challenge myself to make a relatively complex game in c language. It implements all of basic features required to play a game:
> Moving pieces in correct turn
> Stopping illegal moves
> Checks, Checkmate, Stalemate
> 50 move draw rule
> Pawn promotion
> Enpassant
> Both Multiplayer and Singleplayer options (but I would recommend playing multiplayer).

What it does not do:
> Make use of the MiniMax Algorithm (I tried, but at the time was difficult for me to implement). So, basically the computer plays randomly generated moves.

It was a fun project with a lot of potential, (potential to start from scratch but better this time).
